I implemented a program in Python that asks the user to give 2 inputs: a key and a plaintext.
The 2 main function are key scheduling (ksa) and the pseudo-random number generation algorithm (prga).
The program then encrypts the plaintext/message with the given key using RC4,
and it prints the encrypted plaintext in the console.
In the end, it decrypts the encrypted plaintext and prints it in the console.
